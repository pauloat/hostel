    <p> We are a Colombian/English couple who as ex-travellers, know everything
    a backpacker needs! We provide a welcoming atmosphere with amazing lake
    views from our balcony, decking area & rooms. Relax in the beautiful town
    or climb the stairs to the top of the rock, La Piedra del Pe√±ol. We can
    provide insider information & arrange many of the activities you can do in
    the area like rock climbing, waterfall hikes & kayaking to name a few!
    <br/><br/>
    Now, after expanding and being open for over a year, we have established
    ourselves as the Number 1 rated Hostel on TripAdvisor, HostelWorld and
    HostelBookers!
